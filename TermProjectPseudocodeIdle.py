#   Call up turtle screen set to a certain size
#   Call up a pop-up box that asks player to input level amount
#   Once input received, the turtle is movable by key commands.
#   A text box in corner shows how many moves remain.
#   Each time a player moves, the movement-counter goes down.
#   If the counter equals zero, a pop-up box appears with a randomly generated math question
#       If the player answeres correctly, the question box disppears and more movement is added
#       Else, the player gets a new randomly generated math question and loses one of his\her three lives
#   This process loops until the player is within specified distance of the treasure point
#   Once the treasure is found on a level, a new level begins with harder questions.
#   A score box with:
#       A score of total movements 
#       A score of correct answers 
#       A score for wrong answers
