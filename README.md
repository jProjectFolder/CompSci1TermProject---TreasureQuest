# CompSci1TermProject---TreasureQuest
Origin:
This game was my original created game for my term project for Computer Science 1 in the fall of 2019 at the University of Houston Clear Lake.
I came up with the concept, defined the requirements, set a timeline, created the game successfully and aced my project.

Game Summary: 
This is a Python math game using python turtles.
The player chooses if they want to play the game.
The player chooses how many levels to play.
The player looks for a treasure chest on each level by moving. 
The treasure is suppose to be hidden, and can be easily set to invisible, but was left visible for demonstration purposes.
Players only have so many movements before they become exhausted and have to answer a math question to gain more movement.
A correct answer the first try gives more movement points then a wrong answer.
There is no limit to the guesses.
Once the player conpletes all the levels, the scores for movement and correct/incorrect answers is shown.
